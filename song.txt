There’s a calm surrender
To the rush of day
It is where we are
это на писала allise
Beats in time with yours
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
To the wild outdoors
There’s a rhyme and reason
Moves us all in turn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
If they only learn
There’s a time for everyone
That we’ve got this far
It’s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
Believe the very best.
Just to be with you
When the heat of the rolling world
Can be turned away
