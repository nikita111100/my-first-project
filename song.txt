There’s a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world
Can be turned away

An enchanted moment,
And it sees me through
It’s enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It’s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we’ve got this far
